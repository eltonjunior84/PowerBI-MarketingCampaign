## Objective

To provide a clear and interactive dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

- Campaign effectiveness  
- Conversion rates  
- Customer demographics  
- Channel performance  
- Spend efficiency by country

## Key Perspectives

The dashboard is divided into four analytical perspectives:

1. **Costumer Perspective** â€“ Performance metrics across all segmented by marketing channels and more general demographics  
2. **Costumer Purchase Behaviour** â€“ Impact of more specific demographics on the Total Spending.  
3. **Campaign Performance Perspective** â€“ Segmentation based on customer attributtes (e.g., age, number of children)  
4. **Point of Sale Performance** â€“ Sales and engagement metrics by country.

## Data Model

The dataset contains customer-level data from a marketing campaign, with each row representing a unique customer. It includes:

- Demographic data: year of birth, education, marital status, country.
- Household info: number of children and teenagers at home.
- Customer behaviour: total spending across product categories (electronics, toys, furniture, utilities, food, clothing), number of purchases via different channels (web, store, catalogue), and use of discounts.
- Engagement metrics: days since last purchase, website visits last month.
- Campaign response: binary indicators of purchases in five past campaigns and a general purchase flag.

### Key Measures:

Key measures include annual income, category-specific spending, channel-specific purchases, and campaign conversion flags.  

> _Note: The original dataset and field names were in Portuguese and have been translated into English for documentation purposes._
